Loads dlls.  No, really, that's it.

Created because PlugY only allows two dlls to be loaded.

Make one of them this dll.

Install:
	* Copy loader.dll and loader.ini to your game or mod dir
	* Load loader with a loader (PlugY, probably.)
	* Add any dlls you want to load to loader.ini
	* ini section is [loader]; e.g.:
		[loader]
		0=mercmod.dll
		1=gemfix.dll
